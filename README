ODSTA
=====

ODSTA stands for Open Drill Stem Test Analysis. Written to determine permeability and initial pressure from pressure build up obtained during the shut in period of a drill stem test, for oil and incompressible fluids.
Tools: Honer plot, derivative loglog plot, Agarwal equivalent time. Also calculates properties of fluids based on p and T.

Mostly a draft, created during my PhD, the program as a monolithic structure based on my workflow itself based on my set of data. Comments are in french, can be translated on request.
